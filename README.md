# üíª Spindle: Your Path to Coding Mastery
> *Spindle is a programming language designed specifically for students familiar with the AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) curriculum. It bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, allowing you to write real, working code based on the concepts they learned in the exam*
>  *Spindle can be ran nativily on the destop by downloading it, or can be ran on it's website!*

# üèÜ Project Goals:
1. **Simplify AP CSP**: Provide a user-friendly interface and clear explanations of complex concepts.
2. **Interactive Learning**: Offer interactive exercises and quizzes to reinforce understanding.
3. **Community Building**: Foster a supportive community of learners and educators.
4. **Open-Source Collaboration**: Encourage contributions from the open-source community to enhance the platform.
